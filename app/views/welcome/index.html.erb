<ul>
  <li><%= link_to "Firehose", entries_path %>: the full list of entries in the system</li>
  <li><%= link_to "View by user", filter_users_path %>: View the users in the system, and view recent entries from any user</li>
  <li><%= link_to "View by action type", filter_actions_path %>: View the actions in the system, and view recent entries for any action</li>
</ul>
